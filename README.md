##### This repo is currently a work in progress.

##### We use the [generalized solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation#Solution_of_the_problem) to the trigonometric interpolation problem to create a trigonometric polynomial. The specific polynomial is calculated from (x,y) coordinates passed to the `generate_extrapolation_plot function`, and the function is drawn over a range of x-values, with the interpolation points superimposed over the function.

##### Example below:
