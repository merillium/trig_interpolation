#### This repo is currently a work in progress.

#### We use the [generalized solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_interpolation#Solution_of_the_problem)
to the trigonometric interpolation problem to create a trigonometric polynomial. 
The generalized solution is calculated based on (x,y) coordinates passed to the generate_extrapolation_plot function, 
and the function is drawn over a range of x-values, with the interpolation points superimposd over the function.
